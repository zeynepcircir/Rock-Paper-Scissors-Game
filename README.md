# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

This is a little rock paper scissors game. Let me explain its features in items:

1)When I press the start button, my rock paper scissors buttons become active.

2)For each choice of the player, the computer also makes a choice and the winner's counter increases. In case of a draw, the counter does not change.

3)At the end of 10 hands, the winner is determined.

4)Selections and winners are listed on the leaderboard at the bottom of the page.
